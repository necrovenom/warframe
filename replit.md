# Simple Dropdown Selection App

## Overview

A minimal Streamlit web application that demonstrates basic user interaction through a dropdown selection interface. The app presents users with a list of technology-related options, allows them to make a selection, and provides feedback upon submission. This serves as a foundational example for building more complex form-based applications with Streamlit.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit - chosen for its simplicity and rapid prototyping capabilities
- **UI Components**: Native Streamlit widgets (selectbox, button, text elements)
- **State Management**: Streamlit's session state for persisting user selections across interactions
- **Layout**: Centered layout configuration for optimal user experience

### Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: Everything contained in `app.py` for simplicity
- **Session state pattern**: Uses `st.session_state` to track submission status and selected values
- **Event-driven interactions**: Button click triggers state updates and UI feedback

### User Interaction Flow
1. User views dropdown with predefined options
2. User selects an option from the dropdown
3. User clicks submit button
4. Application updates session state and displays confirmation
5. Selected value is displayed back to the user

### Design Patterns
- **Stateful UI**: Maintains user selections between interactions
- **Immediate feedback**: Provides success messages and displays selected values
- **Progressive disclosure**: Shows results only after submission

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the user interface and handling user interactions

### Runtime Environment
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Web browser**: Required for accessing the Streamlit application interface

### Development Dependencies
- No additional external APIs, databases, or third-party services required
- Self-contained application with minimal dependencies

# Simple Input Form App

## Overview

A minimal Streamlit web application that demonstrates basic user interaction through a text input interface. The app presents users with a text input box, allows them to enter any text, and provides feedback upon submission. This serves as a foundational example for building more complex form-based applications with Streamlit.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit - chosen for its simplicity and rapid prototyping capabilities
- **UI Components**: Native Streamlit widgets (selectbox, button, text elements)
- **State Management**: Streamlit's session state for persisting user selections across interactions
- **Layout**: Centered layout configuration for optimal user experience

### Application Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: Everything contained in `app.py` for simplicity
- **Session state pattern**: Uses `st.session_state` to track submission status and user input
- **Event-driven interactions**: Button click triggers state updates and UI feedback

### User Interaction Flow
1. User views text input box with placeholder text
2. User enters any text in the input field
3. User clicks submit button
4. Application validates input (ensures it's not empty)
5. Application updates session state and displays confirmation
6. Input text and statistics are displayed back to the user

### Design Patterns
- **Stateful UI**: Maintains user input between interactions
- **Input validation**: Prevents submission of empty text
- **Immediate feedback**: Provides success/error messages and displays entered text
- **Progressive disclosure**: Shows results and statistics only after submission

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the user interface and handling user interactions

### Runtime Environment
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Web browser**: Required for accessing the Streamlit application interface

### Development Dependencies
- No additional external APIs, databases, or third-party services required
- Self-contained application with minimal dependencies
